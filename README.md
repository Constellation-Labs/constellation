## Constellation
This repository is the reference implementation of our **Decentralized Application Integration Platform** using the 
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
programming language. We build a horizontally scalable 
[DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) 
protocol that you can build upon and interface with using common software standards.
