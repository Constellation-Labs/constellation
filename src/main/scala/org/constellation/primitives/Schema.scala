  /*
  Forwarding rules:

  - History is immutable, once an address is 'spent' the data can no longer be modified.

  - This is designed to attempt to prevent cycles in the DAG (i.e. re-use of a key)
    and ensure key uniqueness

  - The remainder serves as the 'forwarding address' to continue receiving funds / and/or act as a terminal
 for adding additional data under the re-use of a previous address

  - Forwarding addresses are not guaranteed respond quickly due to large number of hashes.

  - If the remainder is missing, the output is used to forward.

  - This is how we continue to support people putting up a QR code on TV for instance or long
  standing addresses while preserving immutability. This is not an ideal use case, as
  the closer we can get to one-time-use addresses the more efficient the data structure becomes.

  If someone doesn't ever send from an address, this isn't an issue at all. It's only once they
  attempt to make a TX outward from the address that this is a problem.

  Receipt addresses must act like a 'terminal', only allowing 1 new TX to be added to their data endpoint
  at a time, this is synonymous with the Ethereum account increment counter - except much better.

  Also - the network should vastly prioritize addresses that only receive a single TX, we want
  to discourage using the same destination address for multiple TXs because it will speed
  up the hashing optimizations dramatically

  We actually can still allow spends from an existing address (although we should incredibly strongly
  discourage this because it messes up the hash lookups) but it still needs to be added to the DAG
  AFTER the forwarding address in order to preserve immutability. Requires more discussion.

  The second TX that re-uses an address contains a reference to BOTH the original address and the forwarded
  chain should forwarding be enabled.
