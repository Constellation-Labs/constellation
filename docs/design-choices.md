### On design choices

This file summarizes current resoning for our approach and design decissions, 
reviews and references. Please communicate suggestions by making a thread on the 
[community portal Orion](https://orion.constellationlabs.io/accounts/login/?next=/) 
or approaching the developers on the
[discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/KMSmXbV)

Many decissions can be traced back to the fundamental goal to provide and
accessible, scalable protocol that focuses on solving the consensus task.
