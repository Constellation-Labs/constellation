These docs provide technical information to understand, build and run the code base
developed in this repository. 
The bulk of the docs are in 
[/docs-gh-pages](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/constellation/tree/dev/docs-gh-pages)
and hosted on our
[docs website](https://constellation-labs.github.io/constellation/).

## Wait, there's more...
### :books: Wiki
Note that there is the github Wiki of this repository, which itself holds
information that puts the Constellation approach in context to other distributed
consensus protocols:

* [constellation/wiki](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/constellation/wiki)

There you find content such as
* [comparisons against other projects](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/constellation/wiki/Comparisons-to-other-protocols)
* [recomended literature list](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/constellation/wiki/Recommended-Reading)
* etc.

Next to the links to external literature, the wiki also leads you to our research notes as well as less technical whitepapers, which further motivate our approach.

### :computer: Resource list
A comprehensive resource list which also holds material for developing on top of
the protcol can be found in the awesome-constellatio repository:
